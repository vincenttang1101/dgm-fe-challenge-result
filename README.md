# DGM FE challenge

Hey! Thank you for your application. We appreciate your effort and time in participating this recruitment process. As English will be a part of the test, we encourage you to use it to answer your challenge (not compulsory if you are not comfortable with it). Now letâ€™s take a look at your coding skills.

# Description

Currently at DGM, we're using React and mostly VueJS throughout our projects. We don't want to ask you abstract technical questions during the interview, so we have a small exercise for you.

The exercise is to draw label on image using html/css/javascript. I have prepared for you a file [index.html](https://git.digime.asia/thinh.nguyen/dgm-fe-challenge/-/blob/main/index.html), which contains URL images and a list of the coordinates of 4 points. You can research everything to handle this excercise. We need you draw label on image from a list of coordinates provided and show this image on page. You can write code directly in the file index.html . [Result handled](https://git.digime.asia/thinh.nguyen/dgm-fe-challenge/-/blob/main/result.png)
